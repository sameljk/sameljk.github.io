I am an [MMath student](/publications/) in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Durham University. I am studying courses that branch off macroscopic-level fluid dynamics and quantum field theory (QFT), with a particular interest in the construction of the Standard Model.

I co-host the popular maths podcast Chalkboard Ultra and write and help produce the maths magazine Chalkdust; and also I private tutor GCSE and A-Level students.

I play the keytar for [Quantum Funk Theory](https://instagram.com/thequantumfunktheory) (QFT) and have led multiple jazz bands at my university.
