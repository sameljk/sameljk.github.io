I am an [MMath student](/projects/) in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/) at Durham University. I am studying courses that branch off macroscopic-level fluid dynamics and quantum field theory (QFT), with a particular interest in the construction of the Standard Model.

I co-host the popular maths podcast [Chalkboard Ultra](/projects/), where [Louie Leventhall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louie-leventhall/) and I talk about cool (!) concepts in maths and chat to PhD candiates and lecturers about their research. I write and help produce the maths magazine [Chalkdust](/projects/); I have written a number of articles [as myself](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/author/sam-kay/) and as the cryptic crossword setter [Seuss](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/category/regulars/cryptic/).
Above all that, I [private tutor](/teaching/) GCSE and A-Level students.

I play the keytar for [Quantum Funk Theory](/music/) (QFT) and have led several [jazz bands](/music/) at my university. When I find time to practice my instruments I often pick up the piano, ukulele or any type of guitar.
